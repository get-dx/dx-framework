P1

Like code reviews do not feel like adding value at the moment, but over time, they might be seen as very valuable.

"like a thought that came to mind for me is the difference between sort of like weekly evaluations of like how much progress have you made this week. 
Versus like, if you look back on like several months and say like, how would your team feel like you contributed to the team as a whole? And when I 
look at the things that people have expressed appreciation for me around, it's almost always around a code review. Or like things that would be really 
hard to measure in the moment. Um, but that they have like a, a broader impact overall. It's like, uh, P1 calmly explained to me in this coder view, 
uh, why he, um, had some caution about this particular, uh, issue and he asked questions about it, and then we talked about it together. And then I 
noticed that he brought it up again and again, brought it up in a safe way that asked questions and explained, you know, asked me to consider whether. 
Uh, I had thought about this particular problem and over a period of time, like three months from now, I find those people being like, I'm so glad I get 
to work with P1. Um, but I'm not sure that on a weekly basis, uh, anybody that would have been like, um, uh, P2 added the value that we were looking for this week."

Notes: 
Adding value over time - evaluation should be based on a longer time period to see improvement efforts that are not directly and immediately visible.

P2:

if one has a lot of autonomy (which is good), we also need clarity around what we need to do to meet expectations. This is important for devs to make choices without spending too much time second guessing if this aligns with the expectations of the team/manager.

P5 also talk about that he needs autonomy but also knowing the clear boundaries of that.

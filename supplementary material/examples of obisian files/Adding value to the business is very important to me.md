P11:

"for me, what I find the most valuable in my work is that I'm providing value to the business. So if I'm able to find a bug that may not be fun or interesting. As long as it unblocks the business, I feel that I've done something rewarding that day, um, where or where, like they need any feature that would help them save time and money. I feel more valuable doing that. Um, I'm more about business problems than anything else"

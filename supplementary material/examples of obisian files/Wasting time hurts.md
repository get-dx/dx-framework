P11:

"They immediately don't find a reason to be at the company anymore because, uh, they have done this enough times to know the difference between. Um, losing a battle and losing a war. And I think, I think when they had to do this code base thing and what happened was they got removed from the project and everything. They knew that it was never going to change. Uh, so they started reconsidering or may start moving out and other other folks, if, if it wasn't them leaving, they just were coasting. They were just doing their job and not really caring about it that much. So they started devaluing their time at the company."

Notes:

After wasting your time (proactive) this hurts the most, and people get extremely frustrated (more than people not being proactive), they want to leave or disengage from the company
